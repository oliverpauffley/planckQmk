# The Planck Layout

Largely the default planck layout but setting right "capslock" to be escape when tapped and ctrl when held. Moved the escape key up and swapped with the colon key. 


TODO:
- adjust number layer to use numpad layout.
- figure out what to do for a symbols layer.
- adjust function layer.
